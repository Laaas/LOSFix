#About
This mod completely overhauls how LOS works in NS2.

#Changes

You will only be "sighted" (visible on minimap) if you are **damaged** by an enemy.
If you **move** away, you will lose your sighted status. (10 meters)
If you **wait**, you will also lose your sighted status. (4 seconds)

Each "hit" will reset this.
