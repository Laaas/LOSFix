#About
This mod completely overhauls how LOS works in NS2.

In NS2, if you are "sighted", you will be visible
on the enemy team's minimap.

#Changes

You will **gain** your sighted status if you are hit by an enemy.

You will **lose** your sighted status, if you:
 - Pass through a phase gate
 - Pass through a gorge tunnel
 - Move 10 meters away
 - Wait for 4 seconds
